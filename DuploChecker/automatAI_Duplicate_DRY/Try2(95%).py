There are a few instances of duplicate code that I can see:
1. The `sum_two_numbers()` method is duplicated in all three classes.
2. The `mulwertyu()` method in `LoginScreen` and the `asfsaf()` method in `PaymentScreen` are very similar, with only the variable names being different.
3. The `prime_checker_ValidateChecker()` method in `PaymentScreen` and the `validator_prime_number()` method in `HomeScreen` are similar in that they both check for prime numbers, but there are some differences in their implementation.

To show the duplicate code, I can print the code blocks for the `sum_two_numbers()` method and the similar `mulwertyu()` and `asfsaf()` methods:

```
# Duplicate method: sum_two_numbers()

class paymentScreen:
    
    def sum_two_numbers(self, a, b):
        c = a + b
        return c


class HomeScreen:

        c = a + b
        return c


class LoginScreen:
    
    def sum_two_numbers(self, a, b):
